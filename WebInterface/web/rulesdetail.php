1] If another player has muted you, do NOT attempt to contact them in any other way.<br>
2] Do not ask friends to contact the player who has muted you, this validates as harassment.<br>
3] There is a good reason why another player muted you.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Personally Muting Other Players</b><br>
1] If another player is bothering you, making you angry or upset in any way please use the Personal Mute feature, do <b>not</b> respond in a harsh or rude manner, please simply just Personally Mute the player to avoid conflict or stress to yourself. <br>
2] You can use this feature by clicking the "PLAYERS" button (next to the "HORSES" button which you use to view your horses), and by clicking "List Players Alphabetically". Next to the player's name you will see a "MUTE" button, click it. <br>
3] Players <b>cannot</b> do the following when they are muted by you: Throwing items at you, contacting you in any way (e.g.: by sending you mail), by engaging in socials, etc.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Muted by a Moderator</b><br>
1] Muting is a form of punishment used by Moderators or Admins in order to try and stop a specific action performed by a player. <br>
2] Being muted results in ALL of your chats being barred from use by a player for a given period of time depending on severity.<br>
3] If you are muted, you will be notified as to what you did wrong and for how long you were muted, you will also gain violation points accordingly.<br>
4] If you have been muted, please accept that you have broken a rule - please do not argue as to why you have been muted. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Moderators</b><br>
1] A Horse Isle Moderator is someone who is enabled to enforce the rules of Horse Isle - someone who mediates disputes and attempts to avoid conflict.<br>
2] Players cannot ask to become a moderator, the site Admins will look for helpful players meeting requirements on their own.<br>
3] Moderators are in place in order to enforce rules and keep the game <b>enjoyable</b> for all.<br>
4] Always ensure that you listen carefully to a Horse Isle Moderator. Moderators speak in GREEN text on the Global chat, and have [mod] beside their name when they send you a Personal Message.<br>
5] <b>NOTE:</b> If you feel that a Moderator is treating you unfairly in any way, please file a legitimate Abuse Report.<br>
6] Players who are <b>not</b> Moderators: Please do <b>not</b> attempt to correct other players who have broken a rule - this only singles out the player in question.&nbsp; This is a Moderator's job, and not at all expected of you. <br>
7] Most of the time you will <b>not</b> see a Moderator correcting or warning a player - Moderators correct, or warn using a <b>Personal Message</b> - Please do not assume a Moderator is not dealing with a problem.<br>
8] Friends of Moderators: Please do <b>NOT</b> at any time expect any special treatment towards yourself.&nbsp; You are NOT excluded from the rules, and if you are violating a rule, the Moderator is <b>expected</b> to take action immediately. Moderators giving their friends special treatment will have their status removed.<br>
9] Moderators are not required to help other players - Moderators are players like everyone else. Sometimes they are busy, or working on their own things and Moderators are under <b>no obligation</b> to help. DO NOT be upset when they do not have time to help you, and be grateful when they do. Try making your requests for help to anyone on the server if it's a general game issue.<br>
10] Moderators will NOT send you to Prison Isle for free, please do not ask. <br>
11] If a Moderator tells you that something is a rule, then it's a rule and you need to follow it, whether you can find it in the rules or not.  Moderators do not make up rules.  If you have a serious concern that a Moderator is making things up, feel free to contact support, however, still do as asked.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Multiple Accounts</b><br>
1] Owning more than one account per player is strictly against the rules and is considered cheating. <br>
2] If you have more than one person using the same computer for different accounts, please notify an Admin using the CONTACT US link, and take note of the following:<br>
<b>ONE FREE PLAYER PER HOUSEHOLD PER SERVER LIMIT ADDED:</b> This has unfortunately been
necessary because of all of the cheating. From now on, Only One Free player can connect to a certain server. Example 1: If Players A and B neither subscribe, and both play on Pinto, Now one of them will have to start playing on a different server or subscribe. Example 2: If Player A and B are subscribed to pinto and player C plays on Pinto for free, all 3 will be fine. We are sorry we had to make this change, but way too much of our time has been wasted by free players cheating, So we hope everyone can understand. <br>
3] If you already own more than one account, please notify an Admin immediately, to have it deleted. Failure to do so will result in both accounts being deleted and all of your items lost. <br>
4] A Multiple account is when you sign up for more than one playername; e.g.: JackFrost, JackFrostOne, JackFrostTwo, etc. Signing up to another server with your same Playername is not a multiple account.</font></p><p>

3] Remember that there are people behind the Playernames on Horse Isle, and that sometimes real life does get in the way of Playtime.<br>
4] That being said, you cannot predict when a specific player will be online, and therefore can never expect them to be online at a certain time.<br>
5] Remember <b>NOT</b> to expect another Player to reply to you absolutely immediately if you have sent them a Personal Message - sometimes people are away from the computer for a small while, and therefore cannot respond.<br>
6] Do not get upset if another Player does not respond, there could be many reasons for that, be patient.</font></p><p>

1] Please do NOT discuss island passwords in chat where others may overhear. Please do NOT ask them on any other chat than by using Personal Message.<br>

3] If the passwords are shared on a Public chat, the password will be changed, and players will once again have to get the passwords from the residents.<br>

2] It is not advisable to bring up any topic directly related to ethnicity, arguments could occur.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Raffles/Contests</b><br>
1] The definition of a Raffle: "a form of lottery in which a number of persons buy one or more chances to win a prize." <br>
2] Raffles and contests where you must pay to enter are strictly against the rules. <br>
3] Raffles are a form of gambling, which we do not allow in the game.<br>
4] If you see a player holding a raffle or paying contest, please file an Abuse Report immediately.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Role Playing</b><br>
1] We do not advise that you engage in Role Playing of any kind within the game.  There are many sites out there specific for it.  You may not advertise these sites though.<br>
2] If you feel the need to Role Play in-game, please keep it in a non-public chat like Personally Messaging or Here Chat.  It is allowed in Buddy Chat only if all buddies are participating or don't mind you RPing.  As soon as any buddies are annoyed, you must stop.<br>
3] You may not advertise Role Playing.  If you feel the need to participate, go ahead, but do not use a public chat to find more people.<br>
4] If you feel that the Role Playing is becoming inappropriate, immediately discontinue with it.<br>
5] File an Abuse Report if the conversation is directly inappropriate, breaking any Horse Isle rules, against ANY players still involved or being catalytic to the situation.</font><br><br>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Real Life Advice</b><br>
1] Please do not ask for real life advice on the game or in the forums.  You have no way of knowing who is answering the question and what their experience level is. <br>
2] Taking experience from people on the game could end up causing more problems.  Please see a professional in your area instead.<p> 


<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Releasing Parties</b><br>
1] Players have begun holding Releasing Parties.  What occurs during these is players congregate in one location and release horses.  Most of the time, the agreement is those that release will get the horse back.<br>
2] We highly advise that you do NOT partake in these "parties".  Horses are most frequently lost when a player captures the horse and won't return it.  We will not return horses that are lost in this manner.<br>
3] If you absolutely must hold these "parties", you are not allowed to advertise it and there may not be any entry fee.  You may talk with your buddies about it, or in Here Chat, but no one else should even know about it.<br></font></p><p>


<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Relationships</b><br>
1] Please do NOT get overly personal in your Horse Isle friendships. The game rules and Personal Information rules still stand.<br>
2] Please do NOT actively seek out boyfriends or girlfriends on Horse Isle - this is not a dating site, and in NO way are you allowed to "flirt" with other players. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Uncaught wild horses</b><br>
1] Please do <b>NOT</b> attempt to "sell" the location of a wild horse, if you do not have the space, either point out it's location or move on.<br>
2] If you do this and another player comes up and catches the horse, they do not owe you anything as it was not your horse.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Released Horses</b><br>
1] Please do <b>not</b> attempt to threaten by telling others you are releasing the horse, and will point out the location when money is paid.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Gift Subscriptions</b><br>
1] You are allowed to sell subscriptions for in-game, Horse Isle money, however, Horse Isle does not endorse or recommend this since you must trade on a promise.<br>
2] When selling a subscription, you must buy the subscription via PayPal <b>before</b> receiving the money from the player you are buying the subscription for.  It is far more likely a player will pay you in-game money for a received subscription than it is for a player to pay real money to subscribe someone after they have received the in-game money.<br>
3] If the player you bought a subscription for does not pay you immediately after it shows up on their account (you should be able to tell if they log out and back in with a star) then contact support and we will take the money from the person and give it to you.  If we have to do this, more than what was promised will most likely be taken as a sort of payment for our time in the matter.<br>
4] A player not paying after they received a subscription is one of the <b>only</b> instances where we will go into the other player's account and take what was promised.<br>
5] If the subscription was paid for via PayPal eCheck, then the player receiving the subscription should wait until their account is credited, then pay the person that bought the subscription.<br>
6] DO NOT attempt to claim you are selling a subscription or pawneer order if you are not subscribed yourself.  This could land with you an immediate mute since, from our experience, someone that does not subscribe themselves will not subscribe someone else.<br>
7] For those paying the in-game money for the subscription.  If the player that is buying it insists you pay first, especially because they don't want to be scammed, do not give in.  The more they insist, the more likely it is that they will not follow through once you give the money.<br>
8] Make sure all money/transaction agreements are made On Game thus saved in the games chat logs.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Accounts</b><br>
1] Do not attempt to sell any accounts, whether it be Horse Isle or some other game.<br>
2] If you are caught trying to sell an account, you will be given violations and possibly banned.<br>
3] Do not attempt to buy another player's account.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First of all, it will leave you with more than one account which is also against the rules.  The other problem is the account was set up under that person's email, so they can simply change the password so you no longer have access to it, then sell it to someone else.<br>
4] If you see someone claiming to sell an account, please file an Abuse Report immediately.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Scams</b><br>
1] Scamming of any kind is <b>strictly</b> against the rules.<br>
2] The definition of a scam: "a confidence game or other fraudulent scheme, esp. for making a quick profit; swindle." ( Dictionary.com)<br>
3] Please be aware of other players attempting to scam. Do NOT willingly give out your money, horses or items as that will fall under an unfair trade. <br>
4] The only services that we suggest should pay for are those provided by Horse Isle itself, and not other players. <br>
5] If you notice a player attempting to scam please file an Abuse Report immediately and inform a moderator. <br>
6] Do not trade for a present because it could contain anything.<br>
7] Do not trade something you are not willing to lose.<br>
8] Once a horse or item leaves your account, it no longer belongs to you, although you can file an Abuse Report if an unfair trade has been performed. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Sharing an Account</b><br>
1] Do not share your account with another player.  This means allowing someone else on your account.<br>
2] You are 100% responsible for your account.  Should someone else log into your account, they could cause violations or steal from you.  So, keep your password well hidden and not easy to guess.<br>
3] If a friend or sibling wants to play the game, help them set up their own account.  They need to follow the instructions and use their own email address (or a parent's) and their own password.  Remember, you should not know their password.  Do this instead of letting them use yours.<br>
4] If you are not the account owner, but someone has given you their password, this does not give you the right or the okay to log onto their account, give them violations or remove anything from the account.  Any players we find doing this will have their own account banned.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Spam</b><br>
1] The definition of Spam is: "to post irrelevant messages one or more times in deliberate or accidental violation of rules."<br>
2] Please do <b>NOT</b> spam at any time (posting useless, or similar posts over and over again); <br>
e.g.:<i> "hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii hi hi hi hi hi hi"
"thi salkjfrhighokijfghbddddddddddddddoidtgf;iohj"</i></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Slander</b><br>
1] The definition of Slander is: "a malicious, false, and defamatory statement or report: <i>a slander against his good name.</i>"<br>
2] Please do not slander another player, if you have a problem either mute the player or take it to the Personal Message feature.<br>
3] If you see a player slandering another player, or are being slandered in a public chat please file an Abuse Report immediately and Personally Mute the player. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Stealing</b><br>
1] Please do NOT attempt to steal from others, this is strictly against the rules.<br>
2] Logging onto another player's account and moving things off the account is considered stealing even if the other player gave you their password.  If we find you doing this, you will be banned and lose your account. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Slaughter</b><br>
1] Slaughter topics are <b>inappropriate</b> and should not be discussed at any time, we all love animals and do not appreciate these sorts of topics. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Starting Over/Quitting</b><br>
1] You may quit playing at anytime.  Your account will auto-delete after 183 days (6 months) of inactivity, or 183 days of inactivity after your subscription expires. <br>
2] When you quit, do <b>not</b> give away any horses, money or items.  Should you decide to play again with a new account you could get these things back and that would be cheating.<br>
3] If you feel the need to start over, your account may be deleted after giving sufficient proof that you are the account owner.<br>
4] To have your account deleted so that you can start over, contact support@horseisle.com from the email address you used to create your account.  Again, do <b>not</b> trade anything off your account.  Do <b>not</b> create a new account until we tell you that you may.</font></p><p><font face="verdana" size="2">

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Story Telling</b><br>
1] We do not encourage story telling in a Global or Public chat as it can sometimes be annoying to other players.<br>
2] If you feel the need to engage in Story Telling, please keep the discussion in the Personal Messaging system, or in Buddy Chat.<br>
3] If the Story violates any rules in any way, please file an Abuse report immediately.<br>
4] This note stands for Forums as well, should your Forum post violate rules, the post will be removed immediately. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Suggestions</b><br>
1] Suggestions are well appreciated, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of work to get most suggestions in effect.<br>
2] Admins do review all suggestions - they should be reasonable as it is not possible for some ideas to be carried out.<br>
3] Admins will try and add new breeds, suggestions and updates once to twice monthly, do not be offended if your suggested breeds or ideas are not added immediately - the process takes a long time to complete.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Services Provided by Players</b><br>
1] We do not endorse Horse Isle services attempted to be sold by other players, but do not prohibit the action.<br>
2] Please be careful when considering trading money or items for services rendered, the service might not be performed while the player advertising the service receives and keeps the money or item.<br>
3] Services offered can include but are not limited to: Training, Boarding, Collecting, Gift Subscriptions, etc.<br>
4] There have been cases of players attempting to sell non existent services or items (e.g.: "<i>Horse Maps</i>"); This action is considered scamming, if you are unsure about these services you may contact a Moderator or Admin to verify or report the action. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Training</b><br>
1] We do not advise that you willingly give your horse to another player for it to be trained in exchange for money.&nbsp; We cannot return the horse should it be stolen.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Terms Of Service</b><br>
1] Please ensure that you have read and that you understand fully our Terms of Service. By joining you agree to accept them, and you agree to follow all rules. <br>
2] If you are under the age of 18 and do not understand the Terms of Service, please ask a parent or guardian to help you through them.<br>
3] It is <b>extremely</b> important that you understand the Terms of Service. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Threats</b><br>1] Please do <b>NOT</b> engage in threatening another player in any way.&nbsp; This is strictly against the rules. <br>
2] If someone is threatening you, please Personally Mute the player immediately and file an Abuse Report. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Trading Between Servers</b><br>
1] Trading between servers is not allowed as it is trading on a promise.  For example, you give a horse to a player while on one server and they promise to pay you on a different server.<br>
2] If a player refuses to pay for something they want from you on that server, then do not complete the trade.  Every trade must be fair in and of itself.<br>
3] If for some reason you do complete a trade like this, file a report on that player, though realize you will not get back what was stolen from you.<br>
4] You <b>may</b> buy Subscriptions and Pawneer Orders for players on <b>any</b> server.  The Subscription/Pawneer Order policy must be followed. (see: Selling Gift Subscriptions)  The two players must agree on the purchase while on the server that the receiving player will pay the paying player on.  The receiving player may get the Subscription/Pawneer Order for a different server though.<br>
  For example, PlayerA and PlayerB are on Roan.  PlayerB has agreed to purchase PlayerA a Subscription for the White server.  If the two agree on a price, then PlayerB purchases the sub on White using the Gift Subscription option.  Once PlayerA sees the sub on that server, they then pay PlayerB on Roan.  If PlayerA refuses to pay, or claims that it wasn't credited, then PlayerB needs to email support@horseisle.com to find out if it was credited and to get the payment if it was.  Remember that lying about it not being credited to attempt to get out of paying will most likely get you banned.</font><br><br>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Trading Between Games (between HI1 and HI2)</b><br>
1] Trading between HI1 and HI2 is not allowed as it is trading on a promise.  For example, you give a horse to a player while on HI1 and they promise to pay you on on HI2.<br>
2] If for some reason you do complete a trade like this, file a report on that player, though realize you will not get back what was stolen from you.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Tack Shop Giveaways</b><br>
1] Tack Shop Giveaways are Horse Isle generated special events where players are notified and are told to go to a designated Tack Shop on any given Island to stand the chance of winning a horse.<br>
2] Please do not be offended if you do not win or if another player wins more than you do.&nbsp; The selection is completely random, and the decision is final.<br>
3] Avoid sending Personal Messages asking the winning player if the horse is For Sale - the player will most likely Advertise if they plan to sell the horse.</font></p><p><font face="verdana" size="2">

<b>Trading on a Promise</b><br>
1] Trading on a promise is when one player gives something to another under the promise that the other will do their half of the trade, or return the traded item, at a later time.<br>
2] Horse Isle strongly advises to never do a trade on a promise.  Always be sure a trade is fair in and of itself.<br>
3] Trading on a promise includes, but is not limited to: trading between HI1 and HI2, trading between servers, having another player board or train your horse, lending items/money/horses, trading an item/horse/money with the player promising to pay you back later.<br>
4] If you do complete a trade on a promise and the other player does not fulfil their end of the deal, please file an Abuse Report immediately.<br>
5] Horse Isle does not return items/horses/money that have been stolen.  So be very sure you are happy with a trade before you accept it.<p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Unfair trades</b><br>
1] Once a horse or item leaves your account, it no longer belongs to you, although you can file an Abuse Report if an unfair trade has been performed.<br>
2] The trading system is set up so you both must ACCEPT what is offered.&nbsp; Be sure to include everything in one trade so you are not trading on a promise.&nbsp; If someone didn't offer something agreed upon, then don't ACCEPT the trade.<br>
3] If you were tricked into accepting something, then please file an Abuse Report against the player.<br> </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Violation Points</b><br>
1] Violation points are points that attribute to the amount of times that you have violated a rule and the degree of seriousness involved. <br>
2] This is only shown to you to give you an idea of what you may have done that was against our rules.<br>
3] We will not dispute, nor provide any more details about these Violations.<br>
4] An account needs at <b>least</b> 10 points prior to being "Examined" to see if it requires removal or other steps.<br>
5] Do not be concerned if you have 1 or 2 points against you. It has <b>NO</b> negative effect on your account.<br>
6] Violations "Time Out" after 2 months and are removed from your record. The date shown is when we reviewed the violations, so may be a day or 2 later than the actual violation.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Violence</b><br>
1] Violence is not allowed in the game.  This includes in chat, profiles, descriptions and art room drawings.<br>
2] If you see violent chat or descriptions please file an Abuse Report against that player immediately.</font></p><p>

2] The <b>ONLY</b> websites which are acceptable to discuss are <b>reference</b> sites; e.g.: Google, Yahoo, Dictionary, etc.<br>
3] We cannot control the content on other sites so we don't allow them to be shared.<br>
4] Personal information could be on another website.&nbsp; If you share a website with another player then our attempts to keep you safe by limiting the personal information you can give out is severely compromised.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Wild Horses</b><br>
1] If a horse is free roaming, and uncaught it is considered a Wild Horse.<br>
2] If two players both find this horse, the person who catches it, OWNS it.<br>
3] Please do NOT harass or beg a player if they caught the Wild Horse before you did, it belongs to the player who first caught it.<br>
4] If another player does harass or beg you for it, kindly tell them no, and nicely ask them not to continue asking.<br>
5] If the player continues, Personally Mute them immediately without further responding and file an Abuse Report.</font></p><p>
