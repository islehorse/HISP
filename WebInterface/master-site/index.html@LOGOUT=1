Horse Isle is a vast multi-player horse based world.  It allows for many players to interact while searching for wild 
horses roaming the lands.  Once you have a horse,  you can train it, take care of it, and compete with other players.  Although the world graphics are simple 2D, they have been beautifully designed to create an interesting and vast world to explore.  This land is completely non-violent.  A great place for any aged player to have fun.

<B>REQUIRES:</B><BR>
The game requires Flash 8. So any computer with Flash 8 should be able to run it (PC, MAC, and Linux (with Flash Player 9)).  
However it does use a lot of graphics,  so a slow computer may have troubles.  Any computer bought in the last 3-5 years should be fine.  It also needs quick Internet, so dialup users may not enjoy the game fully.
